				Global Warming

With the increase in the population of the world, different human activities
are also increasing day by day. Due to this , the world's climate is changing , 
making many places colder or warmer than the usual.

As sunlight reaches the surface of the earth , instead of reversing back to
space , some of it get trapped on earth by different green house gases like carbon 
dioxide than makes the earth to warm up.This is called as global warming .

Due to global warming , the chances of natural disasters like flood have increased.
In order to prevent these disaster , we have to reduce the use of fossil fuels
as burning of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum to produce energy , also
produce these harmful green house gases like corbon dioxide , carbon monoxide,
and sulphur dioxide which are responsible for global warming.

These harmful gases are emitted from different vehicles and factories in the
atmosphere where they get mixed with the water vapour present in the air and 
fall in the form of rain on the earth. This type of rain is called as acid rain .
Acid rain is very harmful as it mix with the soil and water bodies on the 
earth and harm the plants , trees and marine life. It also makes different 
architecture like buildings , bridges etc to degenerate faster. Monuments like 
the Taj Mahal , on of the seven wonders , is also losing it's beauty day by day 
due to acid rain.

Goverments of different countries are working hard to reduce the effect of acid 
rain in the atmosphere by treating these harmful gases before the emissions 
from the industries.
