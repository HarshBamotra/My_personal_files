    <h1>BSc.(H) Computer Science</h1>
    <p>The Department of Computer Science offers 3-year B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science 
       programme through constituent colleges of the University of Delhi. The programme 
       provides rigorous foundations of the concepts of Computer Science and Information 
       Technology. In the final year, students also get an opportunity to do project work. 
       Hence the combination of the concepts and training of software tools equip the students 
       to adapt to ever-changing technology. The B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science programme primarily 
       intends to serve as an input for higher degree academic programmes in Computer Science . 
       The programme lays emphasis on building a strong mathematical foundation (about 30% of 
       course work) and includes modules on electronics and humanities as well.</p>
