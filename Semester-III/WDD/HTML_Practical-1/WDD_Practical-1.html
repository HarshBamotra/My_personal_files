		was carried out. Indian army special forces carry out a covert operation to avenge the killing of fellow army men at their <br>
		base by a terrorist group. On the night of 28 September, the commandos leave for the strike in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in <br>
		Mi-17 helicopters. During the mission, Vihaan's helicopter is forced not to cross the Line of Control due to the latest <br>
		intelligence from spies in Pakistan that the Pakistani Army has deployed an "AWAC" Early Warning Radar-based Surface to Air <br>
		all the terrorists on the two launchpads. Similarly, other commando teams also manage to kill all of the terrorists. Vihaan <br>
		comes to their rescue by firing back at the Pakistani gunship, thus driving it away and eliminating the machine gun bunker. <br>
		His team successfully crosses LoC on the Indian side with no casualties. The rest of the assigned teams are also successful <br>
		and are back with no casualties. Vihaan lands at Hindon Air Force Station at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The film ends with him <br>

		Pakistani minister, wakes up and shouts in frustration while seeing the news of India's successful surgical strike. The scene <br>
		cuts to a title card reading "Jai Hind" (Victory to India). <br>
